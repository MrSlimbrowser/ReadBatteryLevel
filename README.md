# ReadBatteryLevel
Reads battery level of Corsair Void Pro headphones from iCUE's memory and writes it to a file. 
<br>iCUE must be installed and running for this tool to work.

## Known Issues:
- When the headphones are turned off the last known battery level will be shown.
- Apparently iCUE 4.x now is a 64bit process. Since MakeMEKs cheatengine-threadstack-finder doesn't support 64bit processes the calculated base address is wrong. Therefore, this program can't get the correct result anymore. At the moment, you can still download icue 3.38.61 on the corsair website though.

<br>Therefore, please, be careful or review the code yourself.

## Available options and their *default values*:
*Notice: the configuration file will be created on launch if it doesnâ€™t exist yet*

|Option|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Processname=*iCUE*|process name from task manager, without .exe|
|CalculateBaseAddress=*true*|Whether or not threadstack.exe should be used to calculate the base address. If set to false, BaseAdress= is used instead and NegativeOffset= will be ignored.|
|useThreadstackNumber=*0*|Which result of threadstack.exe should be used as base address|
|Offset5=*0x34*|Offset as described below|
|Offset4=*0x18*|Offset as described below|
|Offset3=*0xC*|Offset as described below|
|Offset2=*0x4*|Offset as described below|
|Offset1=*0x10*|Offset as described below|
|NegativeOffset=*0xBE8*|First offset from BaseAddress, will be subtracted instead of added|
|BaseAddress=*0x0*|Custom base address used if CalculateBaseAddress is set to false.|
|ResultFilePath=|Custom file path for the result file. Result file contains either battery level or error code|

## Error Codes:
998 = error reading processes memory, the process does not exist or threadstack.exe is missing
<br>997 = battery level out of range, either headphones are not connected or offsets are incorrect
<br>996 = threadstack.exe unexpected output or given UseThreadstackNumber doesn't exist

## Finding Offsets:
In case the provided default offsets don't work for you, use CheatEngine to find a suitable pointer. There are many tutorials available online. Double click on the pointer to show the offsets and use them as shown in the picture below.
<br>*Notice: The battery level read from iCUE is a value between 0 and 100. When the headphones are plugged in the value will be between 95 and 100.*
