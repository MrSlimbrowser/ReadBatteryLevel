# ReadBatteryLevel
Reads battery level of Corsair Void Pro headphones from iCUE's memory and writes it to a file. 
<br>iCUE must be installed and running for this tool to work.

## Known Issues:
When the headphones are turned off the last known battery level will be shown.

## Disclaimer:
Use my program at your own risk! I am not a programmer by profession nor am I responsible for any damages or unwanted behavior.
<br>Therefore, please, be careful or review the code yourself.

## Available options and their *default values*:
*Notice: the configuration file will be created on launch if it doesnâ€™t exist yet*

|Option|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Processname=*iCUE*|process name from task manager, without .exe|
|CalculateBaseAddress=*true*|Whether or not threadstack.exe should be used to calculate the base address. If set to false, BaseAdress= is used instead and NegativeOffset= will be ignored.|
|useThreadstackNumber=*0*|Which result of threadstack.exe should be used as base address|
|Offset5=*0x34*|Offset as described below|
|Offset4=*0x18*|Offset as described below|
|Offset3=*0xC*|Offset as described below|
|Offset2=*0x4*|Offset as described below|
|Offset1=*0x10*|Offset as described below|
|NegativeOffset=*0xBE8*|First offset from BaseAddress, will be subtracted instead of added|
|BaseAddress=*0x0*|Custom base address used if CalculateBaseAddress is set to false.|
|ResultFilePath=|Custom file path for the result file. Result file contains either battery level or error code|

## Error Codes:
998 = error reading processes memory or the process does not exist
<br>997 = battery level out of range, either headphones are not connected or offsets are incorrect
<br>996 = threadstack.exe unexpected output or given UseThreadstackNumber doesn't exist
<br>995 = threadstack.exe missing

## Finding Offsets:
Use CheatEngine to find a suitable pointer. There are many tutorials available online. Double click on the pointer to show the offsets and use them as shown in the picture below.
<br>*Notice: The battery level read from iCUE is a value between 0 and 100. When the headphones are plugged in the value will be between 95 and 100.*
